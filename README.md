# AIRA

Automatic Interpolative Reciprocating Algorithm
Beta 14.03

Overview:
AIRA (Automatic Interpolative Reciprocating Algorithm) is a set of equations, when chained together, allow for multiple analysis data of sets by non-deterministic Turing based methods. These analyzed data sets generate meta-data which are heuristically sorted graphically and then inversed/inverted to allow for quantum level computation for entangled pairing. The entangled pairing reaching data mass of 2/3 of the original meta-data, has statistical power to self-edit the base equations. The process repeats with each generation of equations more precise than previous iteration. Now on beta 14, the maturity of the algorithm requires quantum computational power for the new edits to be processed.

Data Collection:
Meta-data is generated from PDF files containing 20 years of clinical data which are Level of Care/Service rankings which are hashed and encrypted locally before processing. Optical character recognition programs collect the raw data and push it to MATLAB for array generation. The arrays are re-created each run to avoid privacy concerns.

Computational Power:
Several laptops with multi-core processors are networked along with CUDA cores to process the array generation. These data are fed to a “seedbox” online as local bulk storage of generated meta-data is not able to be stored due to space needs. Data is locally cached in a virtual machine that runs in parallel with the “seedbox”, which also is a temporary virtual machine created for this meta-data. 

Rendering
Bulk data arrays in meta-data form are then analyzed for patterns. Globular data sets created from 2D analysis procedures (X, Y; X, -Y; -X, Y; -X, -Y). Then, using Z-axis interpolation, further are shaped graphically by normalization algorithms. Once created, the shaped are analyzed after inversion. Inversions are run through the same normalization algorithms (reciprocating actions). Polar differences allow for entangled pairing at the quantum level and revisional extracts to the base equations are proposed and automatically accepted as edits if meeting statistical significance.

Quantum Computing
Resource allotment of quantum computing (such as D-wave and IBM Watson) requires careful sorting of critical mass entangled pairs found in the rendering process. Once at the quantum level, seconds of time used to validate the pairs that would otherwise take months or years at the conventional computing level are completed and new meta-arrays are created. Such meta-arrays are run in the same rendering engine MATLAB where the host equations are found. Once validated, a new branch equation is created, cataloged, and prepared for the next run.

Sanitization:
At the completion of the computational process the report generated in PDF form is non-editable and is temporary. The inferences from the data sets are able to be viewed and manually recorded if needed. Reports, data arrays, meta-data, meta-arrays and most-importantly virtual machines (seedbox and local) are auto-deleted when closing MATLAB sessions. The seedbox encrypted connection is severed ahead of MATLAB closure to assure no “man-in-the-middle” attacks can take place.
